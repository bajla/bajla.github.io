            <h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
            <p>We are a team of four passionate innovators (Aney Vaishnav, Maj Zabukovnik, Miha Kos, Nino Kolander)
                eager to participate in this hackathon. With our combined expertise in technology and problem-solving,
                we aim to create impactful solutions.
                <br>
                We are also an <strong>experienced team</strong>, having participated in a national high school research
                competition where we received <strong> silver awards and one bronze award</strong>. Beyond school, we
                have <strong> worked for a tech company</strong>, developed <strong> various websites and applications
                </strong> for clients, and pursued numerous <strong> hobby projects</strong>.

            <h2>Our Winning Projects</h2>
            <ul class="projects">
                <li><strong>Cryptography with Eliptic Curves:</strong> We researched the mathematical principles behind
                    elliptic curve cryptography and developed a library in c# based on our findings in which we also
                    implemented diffie-hellman key exchange. The outcome was the
                    creation of a user application that demonstrates the implementation of the obtained
                    knowledge and allows users to engage in encrypted two-way communication through a P2P
                    network. In addition, we compared the performance of our library with a standard encryption
                    library provided by Microsoft and evaluated the resistance of cryptography against attacks
                    from quantum computers. This project earned us <strong> third place in the national
                        competition</strong>. Achieved by Aney Vaishnav and Maj Zabukovnik. <br> <a href="https://www.knjiznica-celje.si/raziskovalne/4202306879.pdf"> link
                        to the research paper</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Blockchain for News Publication:</strong>We built our own blockchain from scratch using the
                    library mentioned above. The research project aimed to explore blockchain technology and create our
                    own implementation. With over 10,000 cryptocurrencies worldwide, we focused on a niche that supports
                    both monetary transactions and news publication, ensuring integrity and preventing censorship. We
                    used strong cryptographic algorithms and implemented a reward system for network stability and
                    self-sufficiency. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly web application for viewing and
                    contributing news. This project also secured <strong>third place in the national
                        competition</strong>. Achieved by Aney Vaishnav and Maj Zabukovnik. <br><a href="https://www.knjiznica-celje.si/raziskovalne/4202410103.pdf"> link
                        to the research paper</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Connecting articial intelligence with a virtual avatar:</strong> This research paper is
                    aimed at a possible connection between professors and AI. We have built a website that serves this
                    purpose. The frontend is built using NextJS and uses AuthJS to authenticate users. All of the data
                    is stored in MongoDB and the data is being served using API built in NestJS. The API also serves as
                    a bridge between the frontend (Handling user input) and backend (Uploading that input to OpenAI API
                    and returning a voice file from Elevenlabs API). This got us a <strong>bronze award</strong>. Achieved by Miha Kos. <br> <a
